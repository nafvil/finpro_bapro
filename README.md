topic : SDG 13 Climate Action
concept: a program that calculates the total amount of CO2 Emissions in a given area to how much impact it has on the environment

**INTRODUCTION**
The program’s Theme represents SDG13 (Climate Action), the goal is to "take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts". 

Climate change is and as climate emergency is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and disasters such as heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods and tropical cyclones, aggravating water availability and management problems, loss of soils and vegetation cover, aggravating and inducing biodiversity loss and ecosystems decline, reducing agricultural production and food security, increasing health risks, damaging critical infrastructure and interrupting the provision of basic services such as water and sanitation, education, energy and transport, but also straining health and social systems everywhere but with countries of the global south more heavily impacted and least able to cope. 

We implement this theme by making a program where we use the data of emission provided by input to calculate how it would contribute to climate changes (How much your Gas equals to). The goal is to spread awareness through showing data of how much an are actively contributing to Climate change per year.

**The Task for the team are as provided:**

NAVIL/Nafvil - Make Structs, Functions and Equations and the structure of the code
MAJID/potuerza - Helps with all Functions that includes data Convertions
AQEEL/aqeelmalikaziz - Work with the for loops and the inputs of the Main Program
